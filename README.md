The two SQA Undergraduate Research Scholarship projects presented in this repository examine the application of quantum computing methods to practical problems in computer networking, with an emphasis on analytical clarity, methodological rigor, and interpretability of results. Both projects are designed to be carried out using quantum simulators in Python with Qiskit, and are structured as self contained research investigations suitable for advanced undergraduate study.

Quantum-Based Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic Using Qiskit’s Variational Quantum Classifier

This project studies the use of Qiskit’s Variational Quantum Classifier to perform supervised binary classification on a synthetic dataset representing network traffic with labeled anomalies. Each data sample corresponds to a one second snapshot of simplified network activity and is described by features such as packets per second, bytes per second, packet drop rate, and protocol identifier. The dataset is balanced between normal and anomalous traffic, where anomalous samples capture characteristic behaviours including traffic bursts, sudden protocol shifts, and sustained high drop rates. The work involves classical preprocessing and feature scaling, quantum feature encoding using a ZZFeatureMap, and training a fixed variational model composed of a feature map and RealAmplitudes ansatz. Model performance is evaluated on a held out test set using accuracy and confusion matrix metrics, with supporting visualizations used to interpret convergence behaviour and misclassifications.

Quantum-Based Diagnosis of Network Congestion Using Statevector Inference

This project explores how quantum statevector simulation can be used as a probabilistic inference mechanism for diagnosing the underlying causes of network congestion in a simplified communication system. The network is modeled as a collection of binary conditions, such as traffic spikes, high utilization on specific links, queue overflows, packet drops, and alert signals. Each condition is represented by a qubit, and logical dependencies between conditions are encoded directly into a quantum circuit using standard quantum gates. By simulating the circuit with the Statevector formalism, the complete probability distribution over all possible combinations of network states is obtained. Conditional inference is then performed by extracting and summing probabilities consistent with observed symptoms, allowing the estimation of likely root causes under different diagnostic scenarios. The project emphasises reasoning under uncertainty, fault propagation, and the interpretability of quantum probabilistic models in a networking context.
